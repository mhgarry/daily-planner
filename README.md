# daily-planner


## Description 
I created a daily event calander from 9am until 5pm based on given source code that funtionally saved events to local storage, can tell which hour it is and showed green for the futere, gray for current, and red for the past, and displays the date at the top. I did this using JavaScript, HTML, bootstrap, and Jquery. 
##features 
A ready to use, color coded, online day planner with blocks for each hour 9am through 5pm. The planner saves data to local storage for the user and the data stays on the calander no matter how many times the user refreshes 
## sources 
    source code from https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/crispy-octo-meme authors https://github.com/Georgeyoo, https://github.com/mfyke, https://github.com/cmathena2u

 ##installation 
 You need some kind of devtools to view the inspector and your local storage data. Google Chrome comes with them and all you have to do is right click, click inspect, and go to the "application" tab and find local storage to see your saved events
